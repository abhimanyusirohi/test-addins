            The Colosseum also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre is an oval
            amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of
            travertine, tuff, and brick-faced concrete, it is the largest
            amphitheatre ever built. Construction began under the emperor
            Vespasian in AD 72,[2] and was completed in AD 80 under his
            successor and heir Titus.
